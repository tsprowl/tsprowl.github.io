                    <li>Blossom is a game made for Professor Robert's Digital Game Development II class using Unreal Engine 4. This game was made as a collaboration with Professor Sutter's Artistic Game Development II class. Our group worked together to create a concept for a nature-based 3D platformer with a grapple mechanic and went from there.</li><li>As the lead audio engineer, I was responsible for creating all of the sound effects, which meant pulling sounds from Freesound.org and personal sound effect libraries, editing them in Reaper to fit our needs, then implementing them in Unreal through a mix of blueprints and C++.</li><li>As the lead level designer, I was responsible for the core design off all the levels. From the tutorial through to the end, I was the one who created the platforming and base design of the levels.</li><li>As a programmer, I was responsible for implementing basic movement of the character, including giving them control in the air. I was also responsible for using code to implement the audio.</li><li>Downloadble on itch.io <a href="https://spryler.itch.io/push-it">here</a></li>

                    <li>No game development project is without challenges, and I faced my fair share. One of the first challenges was that of level design. We originally planned for one our levels to include a ride down a river in a leaf boat, but realized soon into development that it was out of scope. The issue came with how to frame the levels, and we managed to come up with a design we think worked.</li><li>Another challenge that was more personal was the implementation of audio. When it came to platforming, we wanted different noises depending on the type of platform she landed on. When I tried implementing this, the result was that the noise was produced however the player collided with the object, and not when they landed on it. The solution? Place a cube underneath the player that would do the collision detection, resulting in the proper sounds being produced.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Communication is key. We suffered some communication issues with a member of the art team, which harmed our game in the long run. Don't take silence as confirmation, be sure to get acknowledgement of any deadlines and deliverables.</li><li>Audio is never going to be perfect. If you keep working on the audio of a game until it is perfect, you will never stop working on the game. You simply have to get it to a place that is good enough, and then accept it.</li><li>There is no definitive winner between C++ and Blueprints. They are both equally good at separate things. The trick is using them to their strengths, and not trying to wrestle them into place.</li><li>Take the time to properly learn your source control. We used Perforce, and it was the first time any of us had used it. As a result, there were some learning curves to be had. The UI is unintuitive and there would frequently be issues regarding logout times, files not being checked in properly, and unnecessary files being added. The checking out of files was a helpful tool though, to prevent us from overwriting each other's work.</li>
